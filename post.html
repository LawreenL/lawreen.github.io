                    <p>He opened the door quietly and stepped in, trying not to wake me up. But I was already awake and could feel the unsteadiness in his steps. I sat up to face him. He stepped back for a second but then came towards my bed.</p>

                    <p>Keeping a small distance, he handed me a primrose. He was adorably cheesy at all the right moments. It brought a  smile to my face and put his tense expression to rest. I beckoned him to come closer. This is why I asked him to come, after all.</p>

                    <p>When he didn’t budge, I asked him to take off his shirt instead. The question shook him a little, probably bringing him back to reality. I turned off the lamp next to my bed. The only light source left in the room was from the moon. In little streaks, I could see him. Still standing a little far from the bed. I took off my nightdress, making enough noise so he knew what I was doing. Will you just leave me waiting? I asked.</p>

                    <p>A few seconds later, he started to follow. Unbuttoning the shirt I had presented him on his last birthday. At the sound of each step towards me, my heart started to beat louder and louder. I gave a little jump at the sound of his voice calling my name and turned towards him. I had lost myself in a trance but it caused him to falter again.</p>

                    <p>Are you sure you want to do this? Don’t force yourself. He didn’t sound like any twenty year old I knew.</p>

                    <p>Yes, I replied, I want to do this.</p>

                   <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2> -->

                    <p>The moonlight hit my face and we stared at each other for a while. It felt like an eternity that I didn’t want to end. The look in his blue-green eyes turned from doubt to a quiet resolution and grew warm. He moved to sit next to me. Our bare skin brushed each other for a second.</p>

                    <p>It caught us by surprise but it wasn’t enough to stop the momentum anymore. He inched his face closer to mine. Despite my resolve, my heart quivered and my palms began to sweat. He leaned in, causing the mattress to bend in and bring us together. Just as I closed my eyes, I heard him whisper his love and locked my lips.</p>

                    <p>We kissed for a long while. Again and again until we were both out of breath. I smelt the cigarette in his breath. He must have smoked a few before he came, although he had been clean for months. Despite what I had said, I actually loved the smell on him. It felt like a part of his existence. I took in a deep breath and put my arms around his neck and edged him on top of me. I felt his firm muscles and traced his spine. He started to move down. So gently, as if any bit of strength would break me. His kisses shot electricity through my veins and made my back arch up. The touch of his hand on my waist made my breath tremble. To keep myself from bursting out, I tried to distract myself. I looked at the moon outside the window. It was a full moon.</p>

                   <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2> -->

                    <p>It was still nighttime when I opened my eyes. The moon was resting high in the sky. Brighter than ever. He seemed to have also woken up at my movements. A little more at ease, I felt his arm wrap around my stomach. His breath on my ears still made my cheeks heat up. His fingers traced abstract designs on my stomach. Our bodies so close it felt like we were one.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>-->

                    <p>I must have dozed off again because the next time I woke up my head was resting on his arm. The sun had started to peak. Our night was almost over. I didn’t want to bring the thought to my head. My eyes rested on the primrose by the bed. </p>

                    <p>“You can’t live without me?” I asked before I had realized. I didn’t want to bring this up. His eyes looked surprised then noticed the primrose. “You figured it out.” He smiled but his eyes were sad. For the first time that day, I didn’t know what to say. I wanted to tell him to move on but I was too selfish for that. I wanted him. </p>

                    <p>That was the last time I saw him. He never came back to check on me. I knew I had hurt him countless times with my selfish requests. It upset me knowing he was hurting. But at the same time I felt pleasure knowing that long after I was gone, he would still come visit me.</p>

                    <p>Two days after that night, I died.</p>
