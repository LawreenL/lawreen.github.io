                    <p>Listen. Come here. You’ll want to read this.</p>

<p>I had never talked to this man before but hearing his words made me want to take a look. Leaning over the table, I peeked at the book he was holding towards me. It was the next book to the series I read two weeks ago. I had asked the librarian but someone else had already borrowed the book.</p>

<p>My eyes obviously betrayed every attempt I had made to contain my excitement. His chuckle gave away that he’d noticed.</p>

<p>Do you like John Green?</p>

<p>Well, not particularly. But somehow, I’ve managed to read quite a few of his books.</p>

<p>His answer didn’t surprise me. Suddenly, my hair seemed 10 times more silky. I tried to tuck it behind my ear but it slipped out again.</p>

<p>The next day, he handed me another book.</p>

<p>Found this at the bookstore. I think you’ll like it.</p>

<p>Why do you think I’ll like it?</p>

<p>Well, you’re always reading those romantic novels with the tiniest smile on your face?</p>

<p>I felt my cheeks heat up.</p>

<p>Somehow, noticing your reactions made me read the books you’ve read. And suddenly, I had read them all. He laughed.</p>

<p>I wondered how he was able to tell such embarrassing things without any restraint. Or did he not realize what he was saying?</p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p>His eyes widened ever so slightly. I think he just realized. I couldn’t help but let out a giggle.</p>

<p>So have you been stalking me?</p>

<p>Only your books. He said with a playful smile.</p>

<p>Shh!</p>

<p>The cliched librarian shushed us. My head was already playing out all the romantic movies I had seen with this particular scene.</p>

<p>Want to spend a day with me? I know a great bookstore around Main Street.</p>

<p>I already knew which one, but the love guru in my head had already given its response.</p>

<p>Sure! Does this Sunday sound good?</p>
